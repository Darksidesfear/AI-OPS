## üí° Overview

- **AI** powered: uses a LLM AI-Agent to assist and automate
- **O**pen-source: full open-source solution (even the LLM)
- **P**entesting **S**uite: includes several tools for various use cases


The objective of **AI-OPS** is to enhance Penetration Testing operations with an *AI Agent*
capable of planning and executing tasks, whether that's about automating the **Reconnaisance**,
the **Exploitation**, generating a **Report** or just getting another point of view on a target system.

<ins>AI-OPS objective is not replacing human Pentesters</ins>, it is an AI Agent with *human-in-the-loop*
by design, think it as follows: AI will not replace programmers, it makes bad programmers job worse, but 
it enhances great programmers and make them more productive; that's the same objective of AI-OPS.

### Add a Tool

Most Penetration Testing tools are 'simple' CLI programs, so the Agent only needs a Terminal and 
instructions to use the tool, however there are more advanced tools (such as `Metasploit`) that 
need a specific class to be integrated; for this reason there are two ways of adding a tool:
1. **JSON Instructions**: create a file with instructions for the Agent and add it to 
`/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools` (or `../Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools`); all available tools 
that use JSON Instructions are available in `tools_settings`.
```json
{
    "name": "...",
    "tool_description": "...",
    "args_description": [
        "Multiline JSON\n",
        "instructions\n",
        "..."
    ],
    "examples": [
        "<THOUGHT>reason to execute (thought process) </THOUGHT>\n",
        "<TOOL>command (ex. nmap -sV 127.0.0.1)</TOOL>\n"
    ]
}
```

2. **Custom Class**: tools that require more advanced usage can be implemented extending the class
`Tool` at `src.agent.tools.base`; you're welcome to **open an issue** for a tool request/proposal.
