## üí° Overview

**AI-OPS** is an AI-powered, Open-source Penetration testing Suite that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) AI-Agent to assist and automate tasks such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and report generation. 

> **Note:** AI-OPS is designed to enhance, not replace, human penetration testers, similar to how AI enhances great programmers by making them more productive.

## Key Features

- üéÅ **Full Open-Source**: No need for third-party LLM providers; use any model you prefer with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
- üîß **Tool Integration**: Execute common penetration testing tools or integrate new ones without needing to code in Python.
- üìö **Up-to-date Knowledge**: Use the `RAG` system to keep the agent informed with the latest documents and data.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalability**: Independently deployable components allow you to utilize any hardware setup.

## üíª Install
**Requirements**
- Ollama (see [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama))
- Docker (see [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)) (*in development*)

### End-User
1. **Setup**
-  Clone Repository `git clone https://github.com/antoninoLorenzo/AI-OPS.git`

2. **Ollama**
- Launch Ollama **Locally**
  ```
  ./scripts/ollama_serve.* -i OLLAMA_HOST -o OLLAMA_ORIGINS
  ```
  *Note: there is ollama_serve.sh for Linux and ollama_serve.bat for Windows*
- As an alternative see my solution: [Ollama on Colab](https://github.com/antoninoLorenzo/Ollama-on-Colab-with-ngrok)

3. **Agent API**
- Build Docker Image
  ```
  docker build -t ai-ops:api-dev --build-arg ollama_endpoint=ENDPOINT ollama_model=MODEL .
  ```
- Run Docker Container
  ```
  docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-ops:api-dev
  ```

4. **CLI Client**
- Run Client
  ```
  python ai-ops-cli.py --api AGENT_API_ADDRESS
  ```
  
### Development

1. **Setup**
- Clone Repository `git clone https://github.com/antoninoLorenzo/AI-OPS.git`
- Install Python requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install spacy model `python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`


2. **Ollama**
- Set remote origins environment variable:  `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=1.2.3.4,...` *(Optional)*
- Set host environment variable: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` *(Optional)*
- Run ollama: `ollama serve`


3. **Agent API**
- Launch Agent API (*in development*): `fastapi.exe dev ./src/api.py`
  
  -  Access from other machines: `fastapi.exe dev --host 0.0.0.0 ./src/api.py`
  -  Additional Settings in `.env` file:
  ```
  MODEL=model_name
  ENDPOINT=ollama_url
  ```
  *Note: the tools that require root would require also the API to be runned as root*

4. **Setup Tools** (*first time only*)
- move the content of `tools_settings` to `<user home>/.aiops/tools`.

5. **CLI Client**
- Run Client
  ```
  python ai-ops-cli.py --api AGENT_API_ADDRESS
  ```

## üìù Usage

After deploying the Large Language Model (LLM) with Ollama and the AI Agent API, you can access the API using **ai-ops-cli.py**. 
If you have deployed the AI Agent API using Docker on a specific machine (e.g., an old laptop), you can specify the Agent API endpoint with the `--api` option.

To view the available options and commands, run `python ai-ops-cli.py -h`:
```
usage: ai-ops-cli.py [-h] [--api API]        
                                             
options:                                     
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --api API   The Agent API address      
```

### Commands

Once the CLI is running, you can interact with the agent using the following commands:

#### Basic Commands
- `help`   : Display a list of available commands.
- `bye`    : Exit the program.

#### Agent Related Commands
- `chat`   : Open a chat session with the agent.
- `-1`     : Exit the chat session.
- `exec`   : Execute the last plan generated by the agent.
- `plans`  : List all plans created in the current session.

#### Session Related Commands
- `new`    : Create a new session.
- `save`   : Save the current session.
- `delete` : Delete a saved session from the persistent storage.
- `list`   : Display all saved sessions.
- `load`   : Load a saved session.```

### Add a Tool

Penetration Testing tools can be integrated using either JSON instructions or custom classes.

1. **JSON Instructions**: create a file with instructions for the Agent and add it to 
`/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools` (or `../Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.aiops/tools`); all available tools 
that use JSON Instructions are available in `tools_settings`.
```json
{
    "name": "...",
    "tool_description": "...",
    "args_description": [
        "Multiline JSON\n",
        "instructions\n",
        "..."
    ],
    "examples": [
        "<THOUGHT>reason to execute (thought process) </THOUGHT>\n",
        "<TOOL>command (ex. nmap -sV 127.0.0.1)</TOOL>\n"
    ]
}
```

2. **Custom Class**: tools that require more advanced usage can be implemented extending the class
`Tool` at `src.agent.tools.base`; you're welcome to **open an issue** for a tool request/proposal.
