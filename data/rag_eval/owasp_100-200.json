Key concepts related to secure design patterns include threat modeling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures. These concepts can be used to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure that systems are designed to be resilient against attack.","99":"The inclusion of 'questions and answers' in the example attack scenarios of the NIST 800-63b, the OWASP ASVS, and the OWASP is prohibited by these frameworks."}}
